    "There are many ways this analysis could have been performed based on different methodolgy and perhaps different data sources. I chose the method I selected as it was a straight forward way to narrow down the options, not complicating what is actually simple in many ways – meeting the the critera for the surrounding venues, and in my case, domain knowledge I have on the subject. I originally intended to use the clustering algorythms to cluster the data, but as it progressed it became obvious that this only complicated the task at hand. The analysis and results are not an end point, but rather a starting point that will guide the next part of the process to find specific store locations. The next part will involve domain knowledge of the industry, and perhaps, of the city itself. But the data analysis and resulting recommendations have greatly narrowed down the best district options based on data and what we can infer from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without leveraging data to make focussed decisions, the process could have been drawn out and resulted in new stores opening in sub-standard areas for this retailer. Data has helped to provide a better strategy and way forward, these data-driven decisions will lead to a better solution in the end.\n",
